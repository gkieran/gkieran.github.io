        <p class="text-custom">
            I've been studying web development for almost 2 years now and when I saw this assignment I just knew I had to make an actual site. Rather then use plain HTML and CSS, or a popular javascript framework like React or Angular, I opted to use TailwindCSS which allowed me to create the layout and basic theme for this site within minutes. The site is hosted using Github Pages, which is a great option because it's free and seamlessly integrates with my Github profile.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-custom">Hoonigan's Epic Events</h2>
        <p class="text-custom">Hoonigan's events are adrenaline-fueled experiences that leave spectators breathless. The Gymkhana series shows jaw-dropping stunts shot in iconic locations like Pikes Peak, Tianmen Mountain, the Bay Bridge, the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles, to even the Hollywood Sign itself. In each video, Ken Block and occasionally rally driver Travis Pastrana use each location as an automotive playground, going absolutely wild and using the space extremely creatively. Of course, a series like this requires a large crew to produce, and Hoonigan second-in-command and Producer Brian Scotto does a great job managing the large crew and coming up with locations and stunts as seen in the mini-series The Gymkhana Files.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-custom">Hoonigan's Insane Vehicle Lineup</h2>
      <p class="text-custom">Hoonigan's fleet consists of powerful, purpose-built machines designed to tackle any motorsport challenge with style and flair. One of their most iconic builds, seen many times in the Gymkhana videos, is the custom built 1400 horsepower Ford Mustang RTR, dubbed the Hoonicorn. With its twin turbochargers peeking out of the hood, the striking livery, and the insanely loud exhaust, the Hoonicorn is one of Hoonigans most well known cars. Alongside this absolute beast is their equally powerful Porsche 911, known as the Hoonipigasus, custom built solely for the purpose of running the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb race. The Hoonipigasus has a bubblegum pink livery designed by LA street artist Trouble Andrew, and an absolutely gargantuan rear spoiler, to generate the insane amounts of downforce required to climb Pikes Peak. Possibly one of the coolest features of the Hoonipigasus is its dynamic suspension, which adjusts the ride height of the vehicle based on its GPS location and data from previous Pikes Peak races.
        From the iconic Hoonicorn, to their fleet of rally vehicles for their WRC races, to the Hoonipigasus, Hoonigan's vehicles are a testament to their commitment to engineering excellence.
