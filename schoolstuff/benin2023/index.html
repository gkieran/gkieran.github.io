                    <p class="w3-left-align deeznuts2" style="font-family: Oxygen;">The government of Benin has been working to improve the country's technology infrastructure and access to technology in recent years. One of the main goals is to increase the number of people with access to internet, aiming for 50% of the population to have internet access by 2022. This is being done by putting in more fiber-optic cables and expanding wireless networks. The government has also been making an effort to increase competition in the telecommunications industry, which has led to more affordable internet plans for the citizens. From the stories I've read on the topic, the citizens and government seem quite determined to reach this goal. Additionally, Benin is expanding the use of technology in education and business. More and more people from the country are using more technology in their life, which may come as a surprise to someone with a single story of Africa.</p>

                    <h1 style="font-family: Oxygen; "class="deeznuts1">Economy</h1>
                    <p class="w3-left-align deeznuts2" style="font-family: Oxygen;">Considering that this country is located in Africa, it's quite common to assume that it is poor, that it has been poor, and that it will continue to be poor. And sure, a quick search on Google will verify that assumption. That is only one perspective of the economy of the country, however. As a matter of fact, Benin had a prosperous economy that was fueled by the trade of slaves and natural resources.
                        <br>
                        There were several trade relationships established between Benin artisans and traders along with the Portuguese, which resulted in large profits for Benin. Benin's artwork, gold, ivory, and pepper are among the things that the Portuguese bought consistently from the country.

                        Another economic success of Benin, although quite cruel, was the African slave trade. Benin was heavily involved in this practice, constantly selling men, women, and children to nations like the early United States.
